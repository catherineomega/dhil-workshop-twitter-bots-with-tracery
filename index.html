          ———
          Atom
              - a free code editor made by Github. (You can use any code editor or IDE you prefer.)

          grep
              - a MacOS/Linux/UNIX command-line program that

          sed
              - a MacOS/Linux/UNIX command-line program

          There are Windows alternatives for both of these, but if you’re running Windows and want to do it the UNIX way, you can get the Windows Subsystem for Linux and run common command-line programs like grep and sed using Windows.

          Another option is to NOT scrape text using these tools and just do it by hand. If you’re dealing with a short amount of source material, this might actually be more straightforward and less time-consuming.

          Catherine's Tips for good Tracerying:
          —————————————————
          1. I always use singular names when naming symbols. That way, the output is always grammatically correct when I'm writiing a sentence that references those symbols: "#name# went to the #place#" as opposed to "#names# went to the #places#". But that's me, personally. Consistency is what's important. Find what works for you and stick to it.


          2. Leave comments for yourself!

          Most programming and markup languages have "comments", annotations that the computer ignores and which let programmers leave notes for themselves and others, frequently used to explain what a certain piece of code is doing.

          Many programmers will "comment out" code while they're testing, meaning the code still exists, it's just disabled. Because JSON isn't a programming language, it's a data format, you can't do that.

          But in Tracery, the only symbols that Tracery does anything with are ones mentioned in a symbol that gets called by "origin". That means you can add new symbols like this:
            "comment_fact_fragment": ["These are sentences that would usually follow one of the above: 'It is a heckin' good pupper."],


          3. If you're working on your grammar but don't want to edit the whole file at once, add a few symbols like "origin2" and "origin3". They won't get called, but by naming them that, you'll reemember where you are:


          4. Are you tired of your bot turning "#name#" and #name# went to the #place#" turning into "Catherine and Catherine went to the store"? Even if you add hundreds of items to "name", it can still happen!

          To avoid, how about splitting #name# into two lists to prevent duplicates? "#name1# and #name2# went to the #place#"?

          If you have a sentence that only calls for one name, you can call a new symbol named  something like #any_name#, and in turn, let it choose from either name1 or name2:

          "any_name": ["#name1#", "#name2#"],


          5. A useful tool when editing Tracery files in Atom is the "highlight-selected" package. This allows you to double-click any word and see every instance of that word highlighted in your code.
